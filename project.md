# Projects build with Python

**1)Contact Book**

*This is one of the excellent python projects for beginners. Everyone uses a contact book to save contact details, including name, address, phone number, and even email address. This is a command-line project where you will design a contact book application that users can use to save and find contact details. The application should also allow users to update contact information, delete contacts, and list saved contacts. The SQLite database is the ideal platform for saving contacts. To handle a project with Python for beginners can be helpful to build your career with a good start.*

**2)Email Slicer**

*This is one of the convenient python projects that has a lot of use in the future. The program helps get you the username and domain name from an email address. You can even customize the application and send a message to the host with this information.*

**3)Binary search algorithm**

*Have you ever heard the proverb, “finding a needle in a haystack.” This program is designed to do just that- by using a binary search algorithm. You can create a list of random numbers between 0 to 100, with every succeeding number having a difference of 2 between them. When the user inputs a random number, the program will check if that number is included in the list. It will do so by creating two halves of the list. If the program finds the number in the first half of the list, it will eliminate the other half and vice versa. The search will continue until the program finds the number input of the user or until the subarray size becomes 0 (this means that the number is not in the list). This python project idea will help you create an implement an algorithm that searches for an element in a list.*

**4)Desktop Notifier App**

*Have you ever wondered how notifications work? This small python project idea will throw some light on this. The desktop notifier apps run on your system and send you a piece of information after a fixed interval of time. We suggest you use libraries such as notify2, requests, etc. to build such a program.*

**5)YouTube video downloader**

*One of the best ideas to start experimenting with you hands-on python projects for students is working on a YouTube video downloader. More than a billion people watch YouTube every month. Sometimes there are videos we like to download permanently. YouTube doesn’t give you that option, but you can create an app with a simple UI and the ability to download YouTube videos in different formats and video quality. This project looks tough, but it is straightforward when you start working on it.*

**6)Python Website Blocker**

*When we surf the internet, many unwanted websites keep showing up. This is one of the useful python projects where you can build a program that blocks certain websites from opening. This program is beneficial for students who want to study without any social media distractions. Mentioning python project can help your resume look much more interesting than others!,*

**7)Spin a Yarn**

*Things get more interesting here since strings are infinitely more complex to play with at the beginning.

The program first prompts the user to enter a series of inputs. These can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc. Once all the inputs are in place, they are placed in a premade story template using concatenation. In the end, the full story is printed out to read some misintended madness!*

**8)What’s the word?**

*This name focuses on the user having to guess the randomly generated word. You can create a list from which the word would have to be guessed and also set a cap on the number of guesses allowed.

After this, you can create the rules yourself! When the user inputs the word, you can indicate whether the alphabet written appears in this particular position or not. You will need a function to check if the user is inputting alphabets or numbers and to display error messages appropriately.*

**9)Reddit Bot**

*This is one of the excellent python project ideas for beginners. Reddit is a handy platform, and many people want to be online as much as they can. You can program a bot that monitors subreddits and reports whenever they find something useful. It will save Redditors a lot of time and provide helpful information with it.*

**10)Python Command-Line Application**

*Python is known for building outstanding command-line applications. You can create your program, which can help you send emails to other people. The program will ask your credentials and the content of the email, then send the data using your created command line.*

**11)Alarm Clock**

*This is one of the interesting python project ideas. People all across the globe use alarm clock applications. It is quite a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) Python application for an intermediate-level developer. However, this project isn’t your run-of-the-mill alarm clock. In this application, you can input YouTube links in a text file and design the application to read the file. If you set a particular time in the alarm clock, it will pick a random YouTube link from the text file and play the YouTube video.*

**12)Tic-Tac-Toe**

*We all have fond memories of playing Tic-Tac-Toe with our friends in school, don’t we? It is one of the most fun games you can play anywhere – all you need is a pen and paper! Usually, two players can play Tic-Tac-Toe at a time. The players create a 3×3 square grid. This is one of the coolest python project ideas. 

While the first player puts “X” in any one of the squares, and the second player will put an “O” in any square. This process will continue until all the squares are filled with each player putting X and O alternatively. The player who succeeds in creating a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal with three consecutive X or O on the grid wins.

You can use the Pygame library for building this project. Pygame is loaded with all the modules you need for computer graphics and sound.*

**13)Steganography**

*Steganography is the art of hiding a secret message in another form of media, for example, hiding a coded message in an image or video. You can create a program that protects messages inside pictures for you.*

**14)Post-it Notes**

*Post-it notes are an excellent way to note down trivial chores so that you don’t forget to do them. In this project, we’ll make a virtual version of the physical, adhesive post-it notes. The main goal of building this application is to allow users to carry their post-it notes wherever they go (since it is on a digital platform).

The application should have an option for account creation, different layouts for post-it notes, and a categorization feature to allow users to segment their notes. You can consider using Django for this project since it has an in-built user authentication feature.*

**15)Site Connectivity Checker**

*The job of a site connectivity checker is to visit a URL and display the status of that URL, that is, whether or not it is a live URL. Usually, site connectivity checkers visit URLs at regular intervals and return the results each time. This project will work on the same lines – it will check the live status of URLs. Site connectivity checker is one of the interesting python projects for beginners.

You must design the code for this application from scratch. As for your connections, you can either opt for TCP or ICMP. You can use click, docopt, or argparse frameworks for adding commands that will enable users to add and delete URLs from the list of URLs they want to check. *

**16)Content Aggregator**

*The internet is filled with websites, articles, and information. When we want to find something, it is tough to go through each of them. For this use, you can create a content aggregator that automatically searches popular websites and looks for relevant content and then complies with all the content and lets the user choose which content they want. It is very much like Google but unbiased. And this is the perfect idea for your next python project!*

**17)Image Resize Application**

*This is an advanced project which needs you to be well-versed in Machine Learning. We will begin by teaching the program on how to pre-process data, then perform a few resize and rename images tasks. As the program starts learning, it can handle bulk functions at once.*

**18)Python File Explorer**

*This is a significant project as it will test your knowledge on the various concepts of Python. You need to build an app that anyone uses to explore the files in their system. You can also add features like searching and copy-paste. Tkinter is a commendable choice for this project as it makes the development of GUI applications fast and easy.

To create the Python File Explorer using Tkinter, you have to import the filedialog module from Tkinter. This module is designed for opening files and directories and saving them.*
